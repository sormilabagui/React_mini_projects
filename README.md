# 🌸 React Mini Projects Collection

Welcome to my cozy little garden of React experiments! 🌼  
This repository is where I grow my frontend skills by building small, focused projects using **React.js**, exploring hooks, state management, and UI design ✨

## 🌟 What’s Inside

Each folder contains a self-contained mini project built with React. These aren't big production apps — they're bite-sized learning logs that show my growth, consistency, and love for front-end development ❤️

| Project | Description | Features |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| 🧠 `tictactoe` | Classic Tic Tac Toe game | Two-player logic, board UI, turn tracking |
| 🎨 `color-picker` | *(Coming Soon)* A tool to pick & preview colors | useState, live preview, hex/RGB copy |

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **React.js** (Vite-based setup)
